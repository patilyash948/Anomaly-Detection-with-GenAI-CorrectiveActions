# üïµÔ∏è Anomaly Detection Project

This repository contains implementations of anomaly detection using **Isolation Forest**, **XGBoost**, and an overview of how **Generative AI (GenAI)** can be applied to suggest corrective actions after anomalies are detected.  


## üìå What is Anomaly Detection?
Anomaly detection refers to identifying rare items, events, or observations that differ significantly from the majority of the data.  
Such anomalies can indicate:
- Fraudulent transactions  
- Faulty equipment  
- Network intrusions  
- Unusual patterns in datasets

## üöÄ Algorithms Implemented

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Isolation Forest
- **Concept**:  
  Isolation Forest works on the principle of isolating anomalies instead of profiling normal data.  
  Anomalies are easier to isolate because they are fewer and different.  

- **Key Points**:  
  - Efficient for high-dimensional datasets.  
  - Unsupervised learning algorithm.  
  - Based on random partitioning of data.  
 

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ XGBoost for Anomaly Detection
- **Concept**:  
  XGBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm usually used for classification/regression.  
  For anomaly detection, it can be adapted by treating anomalies as a separate class in a supervised setting.  

- **Key Points**:  
  - Requires labeled dataset (normal vs anomaly).  
  - Extremely fast and accurate for large-scale data.  
  - Supports regularization to reduce overfitting.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Generative AI for Action Suggestions
- **Concept**:  
  While Isolation Forest and XGBoost detect anomalies, **Generative AI (GenAI)** can go a step further by suggesting possible **actions or explanations** for those anomalies.  

- **Why GenAI?**  
  - Traditional ML models only **flag anomalies**.  
  - GenAI can **analyze context** and provide **next steps**, e.g.:
    - In finance ‚Üí Suggest verifying a flagged transaction or blocking a suspicious account.  
    - In IoT/sensors ‚Üí Suggest recalibration or preventive maintenance if a sensor anomaly is detected.  
    - In cybersecurity ‚Üí Recommend blocking an IP or alerting the admin.  

- **Example Workflow**:
  1. **Isolation Forest/XGBoost** detects anomalies.  
  2. **GenAI model** interprets the anomaly in plain language.  
  3. **GenAI suggests actions**: ‚ÄúThis transaction is likely fraudulent ‚Üí recommend contacting the customer before approval.‚Äù
